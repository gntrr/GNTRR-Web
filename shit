              <p style="color: #b3b3b3">
                Remember where we met for the first time? at night where i pick you up and going nongki just two of us? since that day, that moment still stuck in my head. The day that we talked about anything until you got called by ur mom to go to home. And i started to like you from that but yeah.. im still shy to said that to you.
                <br>
                <br>
                And you remember the next day we going nongki to Wonosalam, exactly at Sumber Biru maybe (im forgot that name haha). Yes, we going date for the first time to that place. Still talked about anything, did a little 'play water', and got a little rest at the gazebo, im still remember it today. And one moment where you hug me in a way to go home and sleep on my back. i just wanna nostalgic that moment again..
                <br>
                <br>
                And a things that made us to be right now is because of me. Im just want to understand you if there is a second chance. Because i've been broken before exactly a long time ago before i met you that made me forgot how to love someone. even i forgot how to understand you. Sorry for that:(
                <br>
                <br>
                If i can use a second chance, i will try to fix any mistake that i made to you. ehh, i know you still have a midtherm test but i just want to write all things to this one. Honestly it's stuck in my head for a long time till im can't forget it. So, i just wanna say.. would you come back with me? im really want to fix all mistake.
